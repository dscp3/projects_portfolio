									<h2>Background</h2>
									<p>My name is Diego Coimbra and I'm currently a Quality Control and Data Analyst at a retail company in Brazil. In January 2022, I graduated in Chemical Engineering at Federal University of Bahia, in Brazil. Since 2019, I apply Data Analysis tools, such as Microsoft Excel, Python and SQL to solve BI problems and develop projects. More recently, I've developed Tableau skills in order to build powerful visualization dashboards and animations.</p>

									<h2>History</h2>

									<p>My whole career has been related to the industry sector: first, as a Continuous Improvement intern, where I had my first contact with Microsoft Excel, developing projects and automating reports in the sector. Then, I landed another internship, in the Quality Assurance field, where I could develop my Excel skills even further. It was also the first time that I had contact with Python. Furthermore, I was able to lead a strategic project in the sector, regarding finances and Cost of Quality concepts and metodologies.</p>
									<p>Then, after one and a half year, I had the oportunity to stay at the Quality Assurance field  as an analyst. This allowed me to learn more about key Quality concepts, such as GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices), CIP (Cleaning-in-Place) process, Root-Cause Analysis and Audit Programs.</p>
									<p>Finally, on January 2022, I've made another move in my career, now officially towards Data Science, as a Quality Control and Data Analyst, developing my BI skills and applying them to solve even more complex problems.</p>
