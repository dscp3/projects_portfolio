									<h1>Work Experience</h1>
								</header>

								<h2 id="content">Data Science Portfolio Projects</h2>
									<p>Complete data science projects, where I could approach solutions to complex business problems with real datasets, starting from the solution planning until the deployment of the algorithm, using cloud computing tools, such as AWS and GCP</p>


								<h2 id="content">2+ years as a Business Analyst</h2>
									<p>I used different data analysis tools, such as SQL, Python, Excel/Google Sheets, Tableau and Looker to deliver solutions to stakeholders so they could make the best decisions based on data. During this period, I implemented numerous dashboards, reports and ad-hoc analysis regarding Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), performance KPIs and budget planning related to the quality sector.</p>
								
								<h2 id="content">2+ years as an Intern</h2>
									<p>During my graduation, I worked for two different companies as an intern. In my first experience, I monitored production KPIs, such as the Overall Equipment Efficiency (OEE), primarily using Excel to gather data and write meaningful reports to the stakeholders. Later, I changed to the quality assurance sector in another company, where I kept using Excel, but now to study different metrics, such as non-conformity issues and risk analysis, as well as budget planning.</p>
